Recipe for Disaster is a simple tool that will recommend recipes based on ingredients you enter.  It will score each recommended recipe based on how it
matches your requirements.  You can also add recipes.

While this program has database-like functions and is optimized to search through a large database, it currently does not have a database.  I'm trying 
to make it a react thing so I can use MongoDB.

Recipe for Disaster was built entirely by Tristan Gottshall (HUHS class of 2025) for the AP CSP final project.
